<Project's title>
A cat-themed IOS app that makes treatment schedules more fun.

About this project:

Countless patients face challenges sticking to their treatment plans, but this app is here to change that! Through gamification, it inspires and motivates you, making the treatment journey smooth and engaging. Say goodbye to viewing medication as an enemyâ€”this app turns it into a trusted friend on the path to better health!

In our project, we have a pet cat that requires food. You will need to earn coins to buy food for the cat, and the only way to earn coins is by completing their daily treatment schedule (such as taking medicine at 9:00 am). The cat would also interact with the user using dialogue, and you will be able to respond accordingly.
