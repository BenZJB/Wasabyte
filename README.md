HealthThrive
A cat-themed IOS app making treatment schedules more fun.

About this project:

Countless patients face challenges sticking to their treatment plans, but this app is here to change that! Through gamification, it inspires and motivates you, making the treatment journey smooth and engaging. Say goodbye to viewing medication as an enemy—this app turns it into a trusted friend on the path to better health!
In our project, we feature a pet cat that needs food, and users must earn coins to purchase it. Coins can only be earned by completing daily treatment tasks, like taking medicine at 9:00 am. The cat will also interact with the user through dialogue and will grow in size as it’s fed.

HOME page: 
1. A scanner to analyze your health record and capture your treatment plans, including medication names and dosage.
2. A calendar displaying your treatment schedule.
3. An option to edit your username.
4. Checkboxes to mark each completed task, with a progress ring to visually track your progress.
5. After checking off tasks, you’ll earn cat coins, and a reward prompt will appear.

Now, it's time to get your cat some food!

STORE page:
Show the total number of cat coins available.
Display a list of food options for the cat, available for purchase.

Now you can feed your cat!

CAT page:
Choose food from the available options.
After each feeding, the cat responds with unique reactions generated by OpenAI’s API.
The cat’s size increases with each feeding.
   
Challenges we faced:

We first considered creating a health record analyzer to process PDFs and offer lifestyle suggestions. However, we realized that without detailed personal data, the advice might lack helpful specificity. So, we redirected our focus to motivating users to follow treatment plans. Instead of simply reformatting treatment plans, we chose a more engaging, gamified approach by introducing a digital pet cat as a motivational element.

We faced minor technical issues like conflicting pushes and code collisions, which we fixed with force pushes. Another challenge was enabling access to shared variables, like the “cat coin” counter, across Swift pages. We resolved this by using an environment object, setting up an observable object, and injecting it into the SwiftUI environment for shared access. 

Configuring API endpoints and formatting HTTP requests to meet OpenAI’s standards was another major challenge. By carefully reviewing documentation and testing configurations, we achieved reliable API integration. 

Initially, we planned a color-coded calendar where each day turned green upon treatment completion. Due to Swift’s calendar library limitations, we prioritized data storage instead. Now, the calendar holds each day’s treatment plan and lets users view scheduled treatments per day.

Future vision:
Given more time, we envision adding a community feature where patients can connect, support each other, and engage in a friendly competition to see who excels at “pleasing the cat”!
